"""Grok provider via CDP attach to the per-profile VNC Chromium.

Why CDP attach instead of launch_persistent_context:
- Grok is behind Cloudflare bot protection.
- A fresh Playwright Chromium gets `403 Just-a-moment...` immediately.
- The VNC container's Chromium has cf_clearance from the admin's manual login,

- We attach via http://<container_name>:9222 and drive an existing tab.

        Image-to-image: when `job.attachments` is present, we upload the

        `{fileMetadataId, fileUri}` to `imagine()`. The asset URL gets
        inlined in the message (videoize wire format) so Grok binds the
